SciMLExpectations.jl is a package for quantifying the uncertainties of simulations by
calculating the expectations of observables with respect to input uncertainties. Its goal
is to make it fast and easy to compute solution moments in a differentiable way in order
to enable fast optimization under uncertainty.
